# This is a prediction app.
## The user has to enter the phrase/word input in the text box to get an output that is a predicted word.
### The text input is split by words and the number of words is counted. If a single word is entered the algorithm uses the bigram data tompredict the output. If a phrase with two words is entered the algorithm uses the trigram data to output the next predicted word.
### Similarly, quadgram, quintgram and sextgram data are used to predict the next words after three, four or five word counts respectively.
